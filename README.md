# Super-Resolution
Image resolution describes the image's level of detail â€“ higher resolution means more image detail. 
In digital imaging, the resolution is often measured as a pixel count. 
A pixel (short for picture element) is a single point or a tiny square in a graphic image stored in an ordered rectangular grid.

Super-resolution imaging (SR) is a class of techniques that enhance (increase) the resolution of an imaging system. 
In optical SR the diffraction limit of systems is transcended, while in geometrical SR the resolution of digital imaging sensors is enhanced.
